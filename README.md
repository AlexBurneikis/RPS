## Developing

After cloning this repo, the first thing you will want to do, is to install the dependencies.

```bash
cd RPS/
pnpm install
```

I personally prefer [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management, but `npm`, and `yarn` will work just fine üòÅ .

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

If you use `npm`, you can use the `npm run dev` command to start the server and open the app in a new browser tab.
If you use `yarn`, you can use the `yarn run dev` command to start the server and open the app in a new browser tab.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
